# Fil de Fer - Wireframe

Projects elevation maps into a 3D height map, with modifiable projection type, color or elevation !
Done in C with homemade math and libc libraries, to get intimate with vectors and matrixes.

## Motivation

Who doesn't want to zoom past montains, and play with worlds at their commands ? This is the first step. 
I also discovered that my math teacher was right : I *will* need matrix transformation in my life.

## Usage

Requires the MinilibX, a lighter version of the X11 library
